## Shell_Scripting

The power of the command line draws a lot from the existence of powerful command line tools.

Stringing them together grants them explosive potential.

In this module we will learn how to create shell (particularly bourne again shell) scripts which are
more often than not the fastest way to solve shell based problems.

We'll create a basic web-scraper, send tweets, and automate lots of stuff.
