supplementary material.

Vim is cool becuase there is so much we can do with it, and basic level is not that bad.

Lesson Plan:

1. opening vim (or apt-getting it)
2. getting into insert mode
3. writing a file in insert mode
4. getting back to normal mode with ESC
5. writing
6. Getting back into insert mode
7. wq for save and quit

First for a bash script with say and open commands
then for crontab

Field trip: Unnamed Unix Operating system store

Lesson plan 2:

picking up where you left off: `marks

use `m` then any letter to set a mark
`ma` makes `a` a mark

use `'a` to zoom to that mark

use capital letters to set a global mark -- this is the fastest way of zooming between files!!!

Super powerful (you don't really need to leave vim).

Pick up where you left off:

use `\`"` to go to the last place in the file you were editing -- saves a ton of time :thumbsup:


Lesson


Lesson Plan b:

.vimrc file

* syntax on 
* set filetype plugin on
* autoindent on
* set number
* set wrap
* set nowrap
* visualize spaces (important for python and html)


Lesson Plan:

Copypasta And Selection in vim:

yank direction
delete direciton

yank line (twice means do for line)
cut line

Selection -- Visual mode


p for paste -- or P for paste

pasting inline, pasting before, pasting after


Mass editing:

macros
* running in series
* running in parallel

discussion

command mode substitution

search and do with the . macro.


Programming in Vim:

Simple python hello world.
Simple bash script -- check for word appearance
Simple c program.
Simple Arduino program

Using vim with git:

git init -- starts keeping track of changes (allows you to take snapshots)
git remote add name_of_remote url

git add *
git commit 
git push origin master









Lesson Plan

Other commands
* set paste
* 

Why would you use vim?

Activity 4:

Sshing into a server and messing with the text.
 

Novelty:

sending encrypted messages in vim

g?



Starting commands:

fast moving in normal mode

getting to and from insert mode




Figure out permutations which reduce the time to next gc, or to minimize the base "b".
