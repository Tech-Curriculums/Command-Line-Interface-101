SSH -- the secure way to shell
==============================

SSH opens up a command line in someone else's computer or web-server, potentially giving you full access to all functions.

This ability will be considered by many of your friends to be **hacking**.


Typical Uses:

* :fire: `Hotfixes` :fire: -- live editing of your website/web-application. 
* System Administration -- locking down your server from being trolled.
* System Admin -- checking in on your system with the power of the command line
* Setting up a Server or another computer remotely
* Getting files from a Server or another computer (using `scp` transfer protocol)


Less Common Uses:

* Live editing of a site (simplifies workflow, but remember to use the git save points!)
* hanging out :smiley:
