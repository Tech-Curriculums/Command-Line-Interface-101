with shell -- in particular, root-shell -- access to a computer you can do whatever you want.

Very powerful -- especially if you get network access (and so are connecting from home or a coffee shop).

### Slide: Control all the things

Access the very heart of your computer, your server, or somebody else's computer or server.

  * creating random websites
