Nano
====

While not as powerful or as ubiquitous as Vim, Nano is becoming more widely adopted as a starter editor.

Vim is better, but I'll still teach this to you so you will be able to be proficient in this environment.


## Command List

Nano in a nutshell:

*Saving and stuff:*

* `Cntl + o` save
* `Cntl + x` exit (and nano will ask if it should save)

*Movements*

* `Cntl + E` go to the end of the line
* `Cntl + A` go to the beginning of the line

*Copypasta*

* `Cntl + K` cut a line
* `Cntl + U` paste a line
