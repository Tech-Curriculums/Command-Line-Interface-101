Sometimes you will want to execute the file you're writing.

If you are just writing a scripting language (python, bash, sh, zsh)

The first two of these executes your script line by line in the chosen scripting langauge



executing in `python` can be either
```vim
  :w !python
```
or

```vim
  :w !python
```

but this saves your file as python :lol:
```vim
  :w! python
```
